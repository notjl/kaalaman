# We have too much and too little at the same time (16-01-23 16:35)

We have too little of a time as we do not last long in this very place, and since we are in the information age, we have too much of knowledge. We do not have the capacity to keep track of all this available knowledge. Albeit, we have ways of employing time management systems such as creating TODO lists, planners, etc. But how about knowledge? How do we track knowledge or store it in a convenient way?

Knowledge or information is everywhere! But we passively learn them. Most often than not we will forget these thoughts/ideas/knowledge. That is a problem, since knowledge is a powerful thing. Knowledge is the new oil, it is the foundation of many ideas and projects.

With the philosophy of Zettelkasten, note taking is a form of structuring and organizing your thoughts/ideas. It helps in creating your **second brain**.
