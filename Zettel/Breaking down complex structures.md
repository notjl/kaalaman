# Breaking down complex structures (15-06-23 17:17)

Take a method or function of a code for example \[like down below]:
```python
def sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:
	return a + b
```
We can then point certain lines or parts of the code what it does. For example, we point a note for the keyword `int` and that note would explain what is that keyword for. This could go to for the `->` operator that is pointing to `int`, we could use an atomic note to help us further explain that.
