# Notes should not just be of importance but interest (16-01-23 16:14)

In creating notes, not only should you jot down important ideas you want to remember. But rather, use this opportunity to write down notes with interest in mind. In this way, it guarantees you being invested in your own notes and creating new ideas from those notes.  [[Literature Notes are written ideas you don't want to forget]] but also notes that you are interested in.
