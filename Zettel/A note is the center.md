# A note is the center (13-07-22 07:12)

It all starts with an idea. But as humans, ideas are but a fleeting thing. An average person would not be able to remember every little detail they thought of. This is where the idea of taking notes of these ideas comes in.

Writing notes or writing in general is the key to all written works. Everything will not be realized unless we write it down. Writing is an essential aspect of learning since the idea we have studied will be jotted down, immortalizing the learning we made.

We fear that we cannot create a sensible paper because of a blank page. It is the irrational fear of not knowing what to write. The struggle will only subside if we have a glimpse of what we **could** write. That is why knowing or just having a note of what to write helps jumpstart a paper.
