# What Data Structure and Algorithms truly is (09-09-23 16:58)

**Data Structure** \[DS]  can be thought of storing data and organizing the data so that it can be use efficiently and optimally. We can think of data structure like storing bolts and nuts based on its size and segregating them in each container that is significant to their size and shape. This gives it the __"Structure"__ part of the DS, the __"Data"__ being the bolts and nuts.

**Algorithm** \[A] can be thought of as the *step-by-step* process of solving a problem.

In essence, DSA is an interrelated topic in which *Algorithm* interacts with *Data Structure*.
