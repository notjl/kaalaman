# Linux is not the operating system (02-09-22 23:05)
It is a common misconception that Linux (pet project by Linus Torvalds) is the operating system. Rather it is the kernel of an operating system, which is GNU (made by RMS). GNU provides the Linux kernel tools and utilities for it to operate as a proper OS.

It has become a meme in the Linux community to call it as GNU/Linux or GNU+Linux.
