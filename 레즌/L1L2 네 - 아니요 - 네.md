# ë ˆë²¨ 1 ë ˆì¦Œ 2: ë„¤ / ì•„ë‹ˆìš” / ë„¤? (09-08-22 21:16)
In Korean, "Yes" is ë„¤ and "No" is ì•„ë‹ˆìš”. However, they're not the same with their English counterparts. That's because ë„¤ means to "agree" or expression of one's agreement. ì•„ë‹ˆìš” expresses one's "denial" or "disagreement".

One can also ë„¤ as a filler word for sentences.

In order to emphasize one's agreement because ë„¤ can also mean "I see" or "Right", Koreans often use ë§žì•„ìš”after ë„¤. (ë„¤, ë§žì•„ìš”)

ë„¤ can also be use if you don't understand what one was saying or wasn't paying attention enough. (Pardon? Sorry, wasn't listening, what was it again? What did you say?)
