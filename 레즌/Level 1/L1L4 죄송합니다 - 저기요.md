# 레벨 1 레즌 4: 죄송합니다 / 저기요 (11-08-22 11:15)
## Lesson Notes
In [[L1L1 안녕하세요 - 감사합니다|Lesson 1]], we learned about 감사합니다 and how it is formed (it being 감사 + 합니다). 합니다 can be used in many verb, in this lesson we can use it to form "I am sorry" / "I apologize" which is 죄송함니다 [joesonghamnida].
```ad-warning
죄송합니다 is not the English equivalent of "I'm sorry".

In the English language, when we hear bad news, we often say "I'm sorry". But in Korean context, we cannot use 죄송합니다. Because strictly, it means "I apologize", "it was my bad", or "mea culpa". It can't be "I'm sorry to hear that."
```

저기요 [jeogiyo] is an expression which in English can be translated to "Excuse me." But can only be used in these situation/s:
	- Getting someone's attention and talk to them or let them know something
	- Getting the waiter's attention to put an order.
