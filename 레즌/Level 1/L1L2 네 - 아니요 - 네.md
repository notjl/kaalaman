# ë ˆë²¨ 1 ë ˆì¦Œ 2: ë„¤ / ì•„ë‹ˆìš” / ë„¤? (11-08-22 09:55)
## Lesson Notes
ë„¤ [ne] is an affirmative word in Korean and its antonym is ì•„ë‹ˆ [ani] / ì•„ë‹ˆìš” [aniyo]. Unlike its English counterpart, they do not work the same. Since ë„¤ and ì•„ë‹ˆìš” is to express one's agreement or disagreement to what the other person said.
```ad-example
ì»¤í”¼ ì•ˆ ì¢‹ì•„í•´ìš”? [keopi an joaheayo?]
ì•„ë‹ˆìš”, ì¢‹ì•„í•´ìš”. [aniyo, joaheayo.]

In this example, it shows that the second person is the disagreeing with question asked. In essence, it is "Yes, I like coffee", the english counterpart would be "**No**, I like coffee"
```
ë„¤ can also be used as conversation filler. Meaning, it can be use not necessarily to agree, It could be interpreted as "hm"/"mhm". Basically, it can be interpreted as **affirming** that you are listening.

ë„¤ and ì•„ë‹ˆìš” as affirmatory and negatory words, it can be used as **"I see"** or **"Right"**. To emphasize you are agreeing, you can add ë§žì•„ìš” [majayo] after ë„¤.

Just like in English, ë„¤ can also be used if you don't understand someone's saying or wasn't paying attention. Basically, it can be used to say **"Pardon?"** or in Korean **"ë„¤?"**
